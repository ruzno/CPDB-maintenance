Plants must be equipped with thermal accumulation systems. On top of the selling price, net electricity produced by thermodynamic solar plants commissioned after 18 July 2008 can obtain a feed-in premium for 25 years. Up to 2012 the bonus varies from EUR 0.22 to EUR 0.28 / kWh depending on the level of integration of the plants. In case of hybrid plants, the feed-in tariff decreases depending on the ratio between the amount of energy not produced by a solar energy source and the amount produced by a solar energy source. The maximum cumulative power of all solar thermodynamic plants eligible for the incentives corresponds to 1.5 million m2 of cumulative surface. The national objective of total power to be installed by 2016 corresponds to 2 million m2 of cumulative surface. For the 2013-2014 period such bonus values will be reduced by 2% a year; from 2014 onward special Ministerial Decree will define further cuts.
