It also provides tax breaks to encourage production (from farmers and agricultural firms meeting the requirements) and export of biofuels. Such incentives are low export taxes, accelerated depreciation through income tax, VAT break, and exemption from the taxes on Hydrocarbons and Diesel (20% each).
