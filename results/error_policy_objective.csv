A peaking target of 2030 is set at around 370 MtCO2e, while net GHG emissions are projected to reach 200 MtCO2e in 2050. Thailand aims to follow IPCC 2 degree pathways after 2050. 

GHG mitigation measures in the LEDS focus on the energy and transport sectors. In the energy sector these include energy efficiency, technology switching, adoption of renewables and CCS. Renewables are targeted to account for at least 50% of new capacity by 2050. In the transport sector, model shift, energy efficiency, and promotion of low carbon vehicles are the main measures. A target is set for electric vehicles to account for at least 69% of new vehicles by 2035.","Energy efficiency, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Non-energy use, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Renewables",,In force,2021.0,,,,,https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Thailand_LTS1.pdf,44673,,,,,
