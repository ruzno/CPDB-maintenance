Plants must be equipped with thermal accumulation systems. On top of the selling price, net electricity produced by thermodynamic solar plants commissioned after 18 July 2008 can obtain a feed-in premium for 25 years. Up to 2012 the bonus varies from EUR 0.22 to EUR 0.28 / kWh depending on the level of integration of the plants. In case of hybrid plants, the feed-in tariff decreases depending on the ratio between the amount of energy not produced by a solar energy source and the amount produced by a solar energy source. The maximum cumulative power of all solar thermodynamic plants eligible for the incentives corresponds to 1.5 million m2 of cumulative surface. The national objective of total power to be installed by 2016 corresponds to 2 million m2 of cumulative surface. For the 2013-2014 period such bonus values will be reduced by 2% a year; from 2014 onward special Ministerial Decree will define further cuts.

The 10th development Plan allocates 372 billion Riyals for spending on infrastructure, which is about 76% more than what was allocated in the 9th Plan. This will be accompanied by new measures for the rationalization of government spending."" (http://g20.org.tr/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/g20_comprehensive_growth_strategy_saudi_arabia.pdf)
""As a first step towards greater diversification, the plan envisages raising utilisation rates of mineral resources, diversifying sector activities and developing local processing of mining raw materials. In terms of petrochemicals, this will involve developing upstream and downstream industrial activities that depend on oil and gas. Production capacity in the industrial sector will also be expanded in line with the National Industrial Strategy, with an emphasis on projects related to the diversification of energy sources away from oil.

""Based on the policies stipulated in the Strategic Energy Plan, which the Cabinet approved in April 2014, METI established the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Subcommittee under the Strategic Policy Committee of the Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy in order to consider a future vision of a realistic, yet well-balanced energy supply and demand structure. So far, a total of 11 meetings on these matters have been held.
""METI has approved the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook based on the report compiled by the subcommittee.""
The energy and demand outlook for 2030 serves as de facto energy efficiency and renewable energy targets. For renewable energy, it is described that Japan will aim to increase the share of renewables in total electricity generation to 22-24% by 2030. For energy efficiency, it is described that Japan will aim to reduce its final energy use by about 10%, from 361 million kl crude oil equivalent (coe) in 2010 to 326 million kl coe in 2030.
Original title: 長期エネルギー需給見通し. For the primary energy supply, the envision structure for FY2030 is as follows: renewables 13-14%,Nuclear power: 10-11%, Natural gas: 18%, Coal: 25%, LPG: 3%, Oil 30%. For the power source mix, the structure is for FY2030 is as follows: Renewables: 22-24%, Nuclear power 20-22%, LNG: 27%, Coal: 26%, Oil 3%. Renewables are divided into: Geothermal: 1-1.1%; Biomass: 3.7-4.6%, Wind: 1.7%; Solar: 7%; Hydro: 8.8-9.2%. With a projection of economic growth at 1.7%/year, energy efficiency and conservation measures are also expected to allow a 196.1 bn kWh reduction (reduction of 17%).
Japan's INDC is developed based on this Long-Term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook.

The targets set for 2030 are as follows:
- Double the energy self-sufficiency ratio (18% at present, including nuclear power generation) and the domestically-developed fossil fuel supply ratio* (26% at present), and raise the energy independence ratio to about 70 percent from the present 38 percent.
*The ratio of fossil fuel supply from domestic and overseas interests that a Japanese company has a share in the total supply
- Raise the ratio of energy from zero-emission power sources such as nuclear and renewable energy to 70 percent (by more than 50% in 2020) from the present 34%. For this purpose:
Build more than 14 additional nuclear plants (nine by 2020).
Raise the overall plant capacity utilization rate to 90 percent (85% by 2020) from the 60% in 2008.
Maximize the use of renewable energy.
Cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the residential sector by half.
Maintain and raise energy efficiency in the industrial sector to the highest level in the world.
Maintain or achieve top-level shares of global markets for energy-related products and systems.
According to the plan, the goal is to reduce domestic energy-related CO2 emissions by 30 percent in 2030 compared to the 1990 level. Its intention was to increase nuclear energy in the mix to raise Japan's level of energy self-sufficiency, on the assumption this would also enhance energy security. (Although Japan imports all the uranium it needs for nuclear power generation, nuclear power was deemed a ""quasi-domestic energy"" because the government considers it possible to recycle nuclear fuel at home, if the nuclear fuel cycle is based on reprocessing used fuel and using it in fast-breeder reactors.)

• Alberta will phase out all coal-fired electricity generation in the province by 2030.
• Approximately 1/3 of this capacity will be replaced with natural gas, and 2/3 with renewables (up to 30% of Alberta’s total production).
• In the interim, Alberta will impose a carbon tax of $20 a tonne in 2017, $30 a tonne in 2018, and increasing in real terms after that. For the electricity sector, this will apply to coal-fired emissions above what Alberta’s cleanest natural gas-fired plan would emit for the same amount of electricity production.
In November, 2016, the Government of Alberta announced the first competition for new renewable energy development will begin in early 2017 with the successful bidders awarded at the end of 2017. It will be for up to 400 MW of renewable energy. The Government of Alberta also announced major changes to the electricity system. This includes:
• An electricity price ceiling of 6.8 cents/KWh from June 2017 until June 2021
• Partial re-regulation of the Alberta energy market (details TBA)
• Introduction of a capacity market (paired with the existing generation market), to encourage development of renewable generation. The market will be in place by 2021.
• Plan to introduce Bill 34, the Electric Utilities Amendment Act, would allow the Balancing Pool to borrow money from the province to manage its funding obligations. This change, in conjunction with Ministerial Orders that allow the Balancing Pool to smooth price volatility over a longer period of time, would support electricity costs remaining low and stable.",Renewables,,In force,2015,,,Unknown,Mitigation,,,,,,

The initiative is led by the Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) within the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). 
Leaders of industrial companies are invited to take a corporate-wide voluntary Pledge to reduce the energy intensity of their industrial operations by 25% or more in 10 years. By taking the Pledge, companies are recognized as Better Plants Program Partners and, in partnership with DOE, will work to improve energy management and identify the most cost-effective options for energy and carbon savings. 
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Buildings, Better Plants Program is an important partnership which consists of close to 160 industrial companies, representing about 2,400 facilities and 11.4% of the total U.S. manufacturing energy footprint as well as several water and wastewater treatment organizations.
In 2011, the Administration launched the Better Buildings initiative to improve the energy use for commercial, industrial, residential, and public buildings by 20% by 2020. The initiative calls on CEOs, university presidents, building owners, state and local government leaders, and residential housing developers to publicly pledge to reduce the energy use of their entire building portfolios.

The ETS will start with the electricity sector covering around 3.5 Gt CO2 emissions (Stavins, 2017) and is expected to start in 2020 (China Carbon Forum, 2017). After that, gradually other industry sectors, such as cement, steel, petroleum refining and chemicals will be added to the program. The ETS targets is not an absolute emissions gap, but a rate based (CO2/Kwh) cap that is set per category per sector. The rate is based on historical trends and technology benchmarks (Stavins, 2017). For example, coal-fired power plants are expected to have different rates, than gas-fired power plants. In the beginning, the permits of this scheme will be grandfathered to the firms, in this case plants emitting more than 26,000 tonnes of CO2 per year (Carbon Brief, 2017).","Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Energy efficiency, Renewables, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch",,In force,2020,2020,,High,Mitigation,"https://chinaenergyportal.org/en/national-carbon-emissions-trading-market-establishment-program-power-generation-industry/ http://www.chinacarbon.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017-China-Carbon-Pricing-Survey.pdf

The Clean Fuel Standard will require liquid fuel (gasoline, diesel, home heating oil) suppliers to gradually reduce the carbon intensity of the fuels they produce and sell for use in Canada over time, leading to a decrease of approximately 13% (below 2016 levels) in the carbon intensity of our liquid fuels used in Canada by 2030.

It aims to achieve annual GHG emission reductions of 30 Mt by 2030 and will cover all fossil fuels (but with separate requirements for liquid, gaseous and solid fuels). The regulations for the liquid fuel class will be the first regulation published, and are expected to come into force in 2022.

The Clean Fuel Standard is a performance-based approach. It is designed to incentivize innovation and adoption of clean technologies and expand the use of low carbon fuels. It aims to open possibilities for industries to innovate and adopt cleaner technologies to lower their compliance costs.

To help ensure the delivery of these targets, this part of the Act also requires that the Scottish Ministers set annual targets, in secondary legislation, for Scottish emissions from 2010 to 2050. Part 2 of the Act contains provisions which allow Scottish Ministers to establish a Scottish Committee on Climate Change, or to designate an existing body to exercise advisory functions, should it be decided that this is appropriate.
Part 3 places duties on Scottish Ministers requiring that they report regularly to the Scottish Parliament on Scotland's emissions and on the progress being made towards meeting the emissions reduction targets set in the Act. Part 4 places climate change duties on Scottish public bodies. This part also contains powers to enable the Scottish Ministers, by order, to impose further duties on public bodies in relation to climate change. Part 5 includes provisions on climate change including adaptation, forestry, energy efficiency and waste reduction.

However, on 25th April 2011, the Comprehensive Plan for Implementation of the Climate Doctrine to 2020 has been approved. Some of the main actions envisioned in the Doctrine are setting a price on carbon, and enhancing energy efficiency and the expansion of renewables and alternative energy sources. 
The energy targets presented in the Doctrine are: to reduce the share of energy generated from natural gas to 46% or 47% by 2030 (from more than 50% currently); doubling the capacity of nuclear power plants; increase the share of electricity produced from renewables to 1.5% by 2010, 2.5% by 2015 and 4.5% by 2020; and limit the burning of gas produced from oil wells. RE target of 1.5% by 2010, 2.5% by 2015 and 4.5% by 2020 was superseded in 2014 by the State Program on Energy efficiency and Energy Development. Followed by the Comprehensive Plan for Implementation of the Climate Doctrine to 2020. 
National, regional and local authorities are responsible for producing and implementing action plans that are in line with the Doctrine, creating fiscal and financial incentives for the development and deployment of technologies that enhance energy efficiency, and lead to adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. Furthermore, the responsibility to adopt measures that lead to energy efficiency in vehicles, building, services and the production of heat and electricity rest with the enterprises themselves.

The Plan’s objective is to prepare the country’s industry for the new future scenario that is emerging in the horizon, in which carbon productivity, equivalent to the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions per product unit, will be as important as work productivity and other productive factors in defining the international competitiveness of Brazilian industry. In order to do that, it will be necessary to establish management systems for the greenhouse gas emission of the industrial sector as tools to improve competitiveness, in a process similar to the implementation of environmental management systems in the past. 
“The design and implementation of the sector plan is based on the rules established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and do not affect the ongoing validity of such rules, including the commitment with international financial and technological support for the actions of countries not included in Annex and flexibilities for them with regard to measurement, communication and verification of emissions and emission reductions.
“The Industry Plan is based on three pillars:
(i) Gradual implementation of a measurement, reporting and verification system (MRV) for the emission of greenhouse gases produced by industrial activities.
(ii) Action Plan with a set of measures and instruments to encourage emission reductions.
(iii) Creation of an Industry Plan Technical Commission (CTPIn) comprising representatives of the government, industry, civil society and academia, responsible for detailing the Plan’s actions, monitoring and periodical reviews. 
“The Industry Plan adopts as reference a 5% reduction target for emissions in industrial processes and energy use in the industrial sector, in relation to the trend scenario (Business As Usual) projected for 2020. The target’s role is to stimulate improvements to the efficiency of industrial processes and not to hinder economic growth.”
(Government of Brazil, 2013)
Legal base of the Industry Plan is Act no. 12187/2009 and Decree # 7390 of December 9th, 2010.

(https://carbon-pulse.com/44724/) Mexico will launch a pilot national emissions trading scheme in Aug. 2018 with a three-year pilot phase. The pilot is scheduled to last 36 months, between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2022. ""The pilot will cover the energy and industry sectors. Energy encompasses both electricity generation and fossil-fuel extraction and production. Industry includes, among others, the automotive, cement, chemicals, glass, steel, metallurgical, mining, and petrochemicals subsectors, as well as the pulp and paper subsector. Only direct CO2 emissions will be regulated through the pilot, and participation is limited to entities with annual emissions greater than 100,000tCO2. The system is expected to cover around 300 entities in this phase, corresponding to approximately 45% of national emissions."" (ICAP 2019)

New Developments: In 2017, Mexico began a simulation of a voluntary Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and the General Climate Change Law makes the scheme mandatory as soon as its three-year pilot phase concludes. The pilot phase—originally planned to start in August 2018—started operation in January 2020. The ETS will not replace the existing carbon tax.","Energy efficiency, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Non-energy use, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Renewables",,In force,2018,2020,,High,Mitigation,"https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/news-archive/645-mexico-releases-new-draft-regulations-for-pilot-ets#:~:text=%20Mexico%20releases%20new%20draft%20regulations%20for%20pilot;of%20the%20cap%20will%20be%20set...%20More%20

""The new laws adopted within the Reform package include:
• Law on Hydrocarbons (seeks to attract foreign investment to Mexico’s hydrocarbon sector, but also eliminates gasoline subsidies and promotes substitution of oil energy sources by natural gas by establishing lower tax rates for shale gas exploitation; in addition it provides for creation of ‘safeguarded areas’ where hydrocarbon extraction is prohibited)
• Law on the Electricity industry (increase share of renewable electricity, clean energy certification, planning for a smart grid)
• Law on Coordinated Regulatory Organs for the energy matters
• Law on Petróleos Mexicanos (reforms the structure and obligations of the state oil company PEMEX)
• Law on the Federal Electricity Commission
• Law on the Agency for National Industry Security and Environment Protection in the Hydrocarbon Sector (industry operations security and control of hazardous emissions)
• Law on Geothermal Energy (regulates the exploration and exploitation of geothermal energy production for electricity generation and other uses)
• Law on Revenues from Hydrocarbons
• Law on the Mexican Petrol Fund for Stability and Development (revenues from petrol extraction in Mexico, of which at least 40% annually are reserved for long-term savings “for the future generations”, while the rest can be used for investment projects not limited to clean technologies – e.g. oil development projects included)"" (Source: http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/law/energy-reform-package/)
This reform focuses strongly on energy security and the reduction in imports of fossil fuels. It aims to produce 3 million barrels of oil in 2018 and 3.5 million in 2025 as compared to a current production value of 2.5 million. Similarly, the aim is to increase the production of natural gas from the current value of 5700 million cubic feet to 8000 million cubic feet in 2018 and 1400 millions in 2025.
Furthermore, the most polluting power plants will be replaced by clean energy sources and natural gas.","Renewables, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch",,In force,2013,,,High,"Mitigation, Energy security","http://www.pwc.com/mx/es/industrias/archivo/2014-01-mexican-energy-reform-implications.pdf http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/ref/dof/CPEUM_ref_212_20dic13.pdf

The overall goal is to reduce energy consumption within the buildings secotr. For that, the plan aims at: ""1) creating a guarantee fund of more than 50 million euros to help 35,000 low-income households a year; 2) simplifying support for all by transforming the tax credit into a premium and adapting existing loans; 3) enhancing the reliability of the energy label of homes through diagnosis of energy performance (DPE); 4) better training professionals and better controlling the quality of work by reforming the label RGE (recognized guarantor of the environment), investing 30 million euros in the training of professionals and 40 million euros in innovation; 5) encouraging a massive renovation of public buildings of the State and communities by mobilizing 4.8 billion euros; and 6) missioning a start-up to support the renovation of public buildings of local authorities by pooling resources to consolidate contracts, reduce costs and remove contractual, legal and institutional obstacles.""

By the end of the Strategy third implementation phase, the proportion of Eastern energy markets in the Russian energy export of liquid hydrocarbons (oil and oil products) should grow from the current 6 to 22–25%, while natural gas export should grow from 0 to 19–20%. The Strategy sets a 56 percent energy intensity reduction target for 2030 (compared with 2005). It will be accomplished in three stages: the first is a major overhaul of the energy sector; the second emphasizes efficiency gains through new technology within the fuel and energy sectors; and the third stresses economy-wide energy efficiency. The targets for each phase for the various indicators can be found in Annex 3 of the document. To be updated by Energy Strategy of Russia to 2035. A draft of the updated strategy, Energy Strategy Plan to 2035 is currently under review.

""In March 2014, the European Council conclusions called for: ""Speedy implementation of all the measures to meet the target of achieving interconnection of at least 10 % of their installed electricity production capacity for all Member States”. Currently, the average interconnection level stands at about 8%. Taking into account the importance of interconnectors for strengthening security of supply and the need to facilitate cross-border trade, the European Commission proposes to extend the current 10% interconnection target to 15% by 2030 while taking into account the cost aspects and the potential of commercial exchanges in the relevant regions.""
""In 2012, energy from renewable sources was estimated to have contributed 14.1% of EU final energy consumption and should reach the objective of 20% in 2020. Looking beyond 2020, the Commission has proposed to increase the share of renewable energy to at least 27% by 2030.""
""Coal and lignite's CO2-emissions mean that they only have a long-term future in the EU if using Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CCS also offers the potential to further improve gas and oil recovery that would otherwise remain untapped. Therefore, bearing in mind the rather limited uptake of CCS to date, further efforts in research, development and deployment should be made in order to fully benefit from this technology.""
""The Union's energy security is inseparable from the 2030 framework for climate and energy and should be agreed together by the European Council. The transition to a competitive, low-carbon economy will reduce the use of imported fossil fuels by moderating energy demand and exploiting renewable and other indigenous sources of energy.""

The objective of this Regulation is to protect the environment by reducing emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases. Accordingly, this Regulation:
(a) establishes rules on containment, use, recovery and destruction of fluorinated greenhouse gases, and on related ancillary measures;
(b) imposes conditions on the placing on the market of specific products and equipment that contain, or whose functioning relies upon, fluorinated greenhouse gases;
(c) imposes conditions on specific uses of fluorinated greenhouse gases; and
(d) establishes quantitative limits for the placing on the market of hydrofluorocarbons.
Non-CO2 emissions, including fluorinated greenhouse gases but excluding non-CO2 emissions from agriculture, should be reduced by 72 % to 73 % by 2030 and by 70 % to 78 % by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. If based on the reference year 2005, a reduction in non-CO2 emissions, except those from agriculture, of 60 % to 61 % by 2030 is required. Fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions were estimated at 90 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 equivalent in 2005. 
The Commission report of 26 September 2011 on the application, effects and adequacy of Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) concluded that the current containment measures, if fully applied, have the potential to reduce emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases. Those measures should therefore be maintained and clarified on the basis of the experience gained in implementing them
The use of sulphur hexafluoride in magnesium die-casting and in the recycling of magnesium die-casting alloys shall be prohibited. The use of sulphur hexafluoride to fill vehicle tyres shall be prohibited. From 1 January 2020, the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases, with a global warming potential of 2 500 or more, to service or maintain refrigeration equipment with a charge size of 40 tonnes of CO2 equivalent or more, shall be prohibited.

• Reach 94% of forest areas certified under “good forest management practice” by 2018
• Include at least 10.2% of forest area in the ‘payment for ecosystem services’ scheme
• Increase the percentage of restored or rehabilitated forest area from 0.71% in 2013 to 5.45% in 2018 (out of the areas designated for restoration)
• Reduce the annual net deforestation rate from -0.24% in 2010 to -0.20% in 2015 (18% reduction)
• Reduce the percentage of wood sold on illegal markets from 27.6% in 2012 to 0% in 2018 (proxy indicator)
• 8,750,000 tons of avoided CO2e emissions from deforestation and forest degradation by 2018

The forest concession in public forests in Brazil started to be legally handled through the ""Law for the Management of Public Forests"". The costly forest concession, through the payment for the sustainable use of forest products and services, is a way of indirect management that can be applied to National Forests and other types of public forests which are not designated to community use or protected areas of ""full protection"" category. Thus allowing federal, state and local governments to grant to private actors the right to sustainably exploit the goods and services present in public forests. It is worth highlighting the fact that this law does not allow the commercialization of carbon credits and other environmental services by the owner of the concession, as explained in art. 16, 1st paragraph of section VI.
The Brazilian government currently implements a concession policy to exploit timber harvesting on national forestry reserves. The law creates a Brazilian Forest Service, sets up a National Forest Development Fund and puts into effect an infrastructure for sustainable use of public lands (including the use of concessions). The law aims to strengthen forest conservation (especially in the
Amazon) by decreasing land speculation, putting an end to fraudulent property claims (grilagem) and creating a socially inclusive, sustainable forest-based economy. The GoB estimates that approximately 13 million hectares in the Amazon will be opened to public use over the first 10 years of the plan.","Non-energy use, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Energy efficiency, Renewables, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch",,In force,2006,,,Unknown,Mitigation,"http://www2.camara.leg.br/legin/fed/lei/2006/lei-11284-2-marco-2006-541235-norma-pl.html

The objectives of this policy are to reduce projected Brazilian emissions of GHG and to implement measures for adaptation to climate change in Brazil. The focus of this policy is to approach cross-cutting issues both on private and public sector, analysing also the social, political, environmental and economical implications. The policy also establishes the emission reduction targets for Brazil, to between 36,1 and 38,9% of projected emissions, up to 2020. Last year during COP16 in Cancun, that Policy was turned into a Federal Decree (Nº 7.390), regulating the NPCC, and giving details on the path Brazil intends to follow in order to reach its targets by 2020.

The plan identifies the goal of raising domestic content of core components and materials to 40% by 2020 and 70% by 2025.
Although there is a significant role for the state in providing an overall framework, utilizing financial and fiscal tools, and supporting the creation of manufacturing innovation centers (15 by 2020 and 40 by 2025), the plan also calls for relying on market institutions, strengthening intellectual property rights protection for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the more effective use of intellectual property (IP) in business strategy, and allowing firms to self-declare their own technology standards and help them better participate in international standards setting.
Although the goal is to upgrade industry writ large, the plan highlights 10 priority sectors: 1) New advanced information technology; 2) Automated machine tools & robotics; 3) Aerospace and aeronautical equipment; 4) Maritime equipment and high-tech shipping; 5) Modern rail transport equipment; 6) New-energy vehicles and equipment; 7) Power equipment; 8) Agricultural equipment; 9) New materials; and 10) Biopharma and advanced medical products.

The law was designed to stimulate the market for renewable, clean burning fuel.
The B2 biodiesel requirement went into effect and became mandatory as of 1 January 2008. While in 2007 many gas stations began offering B2 biodiesel, all stations now offer only B2 biodiesel. The requirement was modified in March 2008, and as of 1 July 2008, the requirement is that all diesel contain 3% rather than 2% biofuel (B3 biodiesel).
The mandatory biodiesel blending content was increased as of July 2009 to 4%, and further to 5% (B5 biodiesel) as of January 2010. The B5 biodiesel requirement is being implemented three years ahead of its scheduled implementation date of 2012 as per the 2005 law.
In May 2014 the the mandatory biodiesel blending content was increased to 5% starting from 1st of Jul and 7% from 1st November 2014. 
On 24th of March 2016 Law No 13.263 increased mandatory biodiesel blend target to 8% starting from March 2017 to 9% from March 2018 and to 10% from March 2019. 
The targets were reconfirmed by Resolution No 11 of 14 December 2016 by CNPE.

The policy bans new license issuance thus directly contributing to halting deforestation. Earlier this year, the President gave a verbal instruction to completely ban new license for oil palm and mining concession (link). However, the instruction has not been transformed to official national policy thus has no ground for implementation. Other policies (such as FLEGT) are part of overall forest/land use governance policies which does not contain explicit mitigation targets and subject to effective enforcement.
""The Ministry of Forestry, which has been one of the most active with regards to climate change, has established a working group on climate change. However, the centrepiece of the agreement between Indonesia and Norway has been the moratorium on new forestry licences and development of peat land for two years, starting in 2011. This was intended to provide breathing space to facilitate transition to a more sustainable forestry sector. This was extended in 2013 for another two years, while a further decree created a national REDD+ agency."" (LSE, 2015)

The NEP projects electricity demand and supply planning until the fiscal year 2026/27. It has a cumulative target of 175 GW renewable energy capacity by 2022. The NEP foresees coal-fired power capacity additions of 46 GW between 2022 and 2027. 
""It is expected that the share of non-fossil based installed capacity (Nuclear + Hydro + Renewable Sources) will increase to 46.8 % by the end of 2021-22 and will further increase to 56.5 % by the end of 2026-27 considering capacity addition of 50,025 MW coal based capacity already under construction and likely to yield benefits during 2017-
22 and no coal based capacity addition during 2022-27."" (http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/committee/nep/nep_dec.pdf)
It implies that no new coal-fired power plants are necessary beyond those already under construction (Carbon Brief, 2017), and further calls of 57% of electric capacity to be non-fossil by 2027 (Carbon Brief, 2017).
Other targets: Renewable energy generation share of 20% by 2022; Renewable energy generation share of 24% by 2027.
Renewable energy sector is now poised for a quantum jump as India has reset its renewable energy capacity addition target so as to have an installed capacity of 175 GW (100GW solar, 60GW wind, 10GW biomass and 5GW small-hydro) by 2022, in view of the significant renewable energy potential in the country and commitment made by the investors/stakeholders.

The state targets the installation of 1 to 1.2 GW of solar capacity by 2022, seeks to enhance energy security, create jobs in the solar manufacturing and become a main exporter of renewable power to third party and neighboring states. To reach such targets, the solar policy includes a combination of support tools: First, power producers are exempted from electricity duty on the energy they consume and can apply for incentives under the Industry Scheme. Producers of solar thermal energy are granted access to the water quantity required for generation by local authorities and solar power will be guaranteed grid access under both the Indian Solar Mission and the Rajasthan Solar policy. The solar policy seeks to widespread the installation of solar water heating systems on all industrial buildings where hot water is required, large residential buildings, government and private hospitals, hotels and swimming pools. Solar steam systems in residential institutions and hospitals will also be supported. Second, the solar policy creates the RE infrastructure Development Fund to finance transmission network extension, road construction and ease the integration of RE generation. Such Fund will be financed by the collection of a development charge of INR. 10 Lacs per MW installed transfered to the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation. The policy also provides for the regulation framework to develop solar parks larger than 1, 000 MW capacity. Such Parks will include Solar Power Plants, Manufacturing Zones, R & D and Training Centres. Third, the Solar Policy creates the Solar Research Center of excellence. The solar policy will fulfill Rajasthan s engagements in the National Solar Mission -install 66 MW of solar capacity- and install additional capacity following a competitive bidding process. Central government will tender 50 MW of solar PV and 50 MW of solar thermal and best bidders will be guaranteed a fixed price by Discoms of Rajasthan. Moreover, the policy will promote the installation of solar PV and solar thermal plans for direct sale to Discoms of Rajasthan with a maximum capacity of 200 MW by 2013 and an additional 400 MW by 2017. Eligible projects will also be selected through auctions. The state will promote off grid and decentralised solar applications and hybrid systems in replacement of diesel based generators. The solar policy also facilitates the installation of solar power producers targeting solar power trade with third party or other states.

On 17 April 2019, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2019/631 setting CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles (vans) in the EU for the period after 2020. From 2025 on, manufacturers will have to meet the new targets set for the fleet-wide average emissions of new cars and vans registered in a given calendar year, with stricter targets applying from 2030. The Regulation also includes a mechanism to incentivise the uptake of zero- and low-emission vehicles, in a technology-neutral way. The new Regulation will start applying on 1 January 2020, when the current Regulations setting CO2 emission standards for cars and vans will be repealed.
New EU fleet-wide CO2 emission targets are set for the years 2025 and 2030, both for newly registered passenger cars and newly registered vans. These targets are defined as a percentage reduction from the 2021 starting points: 1) Cars: 15% reduction from 2025 on and 37.5% reduction from 2030 on; 2) Vans: 15% reduction from 2025 on and 31% reduction from 2030 on. The specific emission targets for manufacturers to comply with, are based on the EU fleet-wide targets, taking into account the average test mass of a manufacturer's newly registered vehicles.

These outcome-focused regulations apply to upstream oil and gas facilities, which are responsible for extraction, production, processing and transportation of crude oil and natural gas. The requirements target two key methane sources: fugitive emissions, which are unintentional leaks from equipment leaks, and venting emissions, which are intentional releases of methane into the air.
General requirements apply to all covered upstream oil and gas facilities:
Compressors: As of January 1, 2020, covered compressors will be required to take action to conserve or destroy methane, or else to meet applicable vent limits. If a company opts not to conserve or destroy methane, it must demonstrate compliance with the limits via an annual measurement or continuous monitoring. Corrective action is required if those emissions exceed the limit applicable to the compressor, which depends on the installation date, the type of compressor, and its rated brake power.
Well completions involving hydraulic fracturing: As of January 1, 2020, these sites must conserve or destroy gas in most circumstances instead of venting it into the air.
Conditional requirements apply to covered upstream oil and gas facilities handling significant volumes (at least 60,000 cubic metres/year of gas):
Fugitive equipment leaks: As of January 1, 2020, upstream oil and gas facilities are required to start implementation of leak detection and repair program consisting of three comprehensive inspections per year at most upstream oil and gas facilities. Corrective action is required if leaks are discovered.
Facility production venting: As of January 1, 2023, upstream oil and gas facilities must limit annual facility vented volumes of methane to 15,000 m3. These facilities would need to capture the gas and either use it onsite, re-inject it underground, send it to a sales pipeline, or route it to a destruction device. This requirement does not apply to vented gas from:
-specific temporary activities such as emergencies, liquids unloading, or equipment start-ups, shutdowns, and blowdowns;
-facilities that have vented less than 40,000 m3 in the past year without destroying or selling or re-injecting any gas; and
-processing equipment such as glycol dehydrators, compressors and pneumatic devices.
Pneumatic devices:
-Controllers: As of January 1, 2023, facilities using natural-gas-powered pneumatic controllers must ensure that on-going emissions remain below 0.17m³ per hour.
-Pumps: As of January 1, 2023, pneumatic pumps are prohibited from emitting methane where the volume of liquid being pumped exceeds 20 litres per day.

The 2006 Law then included the Renewable Energy Surcharge, a fixed tariff added to the price of each kWh of electricity sold through the grid. The revenue generated by this premium is then to be splited among power distributors and utilities to balance the higher price they have to pay for electricity from renewable energy sources.
In 2006, the renewable energy Premium amounted to CNY 0.001/kWh, equivalent of USD 0.00015. Successive revisions rose it to CNY 0.004/kWh in 2009 to keep paste with the dramatic increase in electricity generation from renewable sources. 
In December 2011, the Surcharge for electricity generated from renewable energy sources increased to CNY 0.008/kwh, equivalent of USD 0.0012.
From 25 September 2013, the surcharge for the renewable electricity generation is increased from RMB 0.008/kWh to RMB 0.015/ kWh. Upgraded subside for coal-fired plants with technology to lower emissions of nitrogen oxide from RMB 0.008/kWh to RMB 0.01/ kWh.

An assessment of the share of renewable energy in the energy mix and the progress made in the last 10 years shows that more and better use could be made of renewables.
In the Road Map, the Commission proposes setting a mandatory target of 20% for renewable energy's share of energy consumption in the EU by 2020 and a mandatory minimum target of 10% for biofuels.

Under the 2008 Climate Change Act, the UK must meet legally binding carbon ""budgets"", committing the UK to cuts its emissions by 34% by 2020 and 80% by 2050.
The Strategy comprises three primary 2020 targets:
Over 30% of electricity to be generated from renewable energy sources, mostly from wind power, with biomass, hydro, wave and tidal power playing important roles;
12% of heat to be generated from renewable energy sources, from a large range of sources (biomass, biogas, solar, heat pumps);
10% of transport energy to come from renewable energy sources.
The key measures to achieve the targets are:
An expansion and extension of the Renewables Obligation, requiring energy suppliers to sell larger amounts of renewable energy. New measures to increase financial support for offshore wind will also be considered.
Introducing payment schemes to support the production of renewable heat and small-scale clean electricity generation by households, industry, businesses and communities.
New guaranteed payments will be provided through feed-in tariff schemes from 2010 onwards, and a Renewable Heat Incentive from 2011 onwards. Before the schemes take effect, GBP 45 million in grants have been committed.
The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation will be amended or replaced, taking into account sustainability issues, to ensure transport fuels contain a rising amount of renewable biofuels.",Renewables,,In force,2009,,,Unknown,Mitigation,https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228866/7686.pdf,,,,,

The majority of medium-distance passenger transport should go by rail by 2050; establish a fully functioning, EU-wide TEN-T core network integrating all forms of transport by 2030; connect major airports to rail and core seaports and rail and inland waterways by 2050; introduce traffic management systems for the various transport modes, such as for rail and road; develop a multimodal transport information management and payment system by 2020; halve road casualties by 2020 and reduce these to almost zero by 2050; fully apply the ‘user pays’ (i.e. those who use infrastructure pay for it) and ‘polluter pays’ (i.e. those who pollute pay for it) principles."" (Source: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:tr0054)
""By 2050, key goals will include:
- No more conventionally-fuelled cars in cities.
- 40% use of sustainable low carbon fuels in aviation; at least 40% cut in shipping emissions.
- A 50% shift of medium distance intercity passenger and freight journeys from road to rail and waterborne transport.
- All of which will contribute to a 60% cut in transport emissions by the middle of the century.""

The SNAP program evolves the list of alternatives as the EPA makes decisions informed by its overall understanding of the environmental and human health impacts as well as its current knowledge about available substitutes. It includes proposed rule listing for new substitutes and prohibiting certain high-GWP HFCs as alternatives under SNAP (4/18/2016) and rules prohibiting certain high-GWP HFCs as alternatives under SNAP. The EPA is driving cost-effective technology adoption through its authority under the Clean Air Act, but the United States should continue to work toward an international phase-down of high-GWP HFC use through the Montreal Protocol (WRI, 2015)

The Strategy on short-lived climate pollutants identifies five key sources of SLCP emissions in Canada, which include:
• on and off-road transportation;
• wood burning appliances;
• oil and gas facilities;
• landfills; 
• stationary diesel engines used in many applications throughout Canada—including for power generation in Northern, remote and Indigenous communities.
The implementation of this strategy seeks to generate reductions from all key SLCP emissions sources, achieve health and climate benefits, signal Canada’s continued commitment to reducing emissions of SLCPs at home and abroad, and position Canada in line with leading jurisdictions.

1. Effective global environmental countermeasures in the power industry
Since effective actions consistent with national plans and targets, are needed in the power sector, promote the development of a sector-wide framework in which;
・The goals are consistent with national plans
・Main business operators including non-regional electric utilities are participating
・Responsible body is clearly defined (focusing on retail stage)
2. Treatment of CO2 within environmental assessment
Evaluate from a stand point below where necessary and reasonable
(a) Adoption of BATs (Best Available Technologies)
・The government will identify and publish “Development and commercialization status of cutting-edge power generation technologies” by size and by fuel types, as s reference for business operators’ consideration and will request business operators to adopt BATs
(b) Consistency with national targets and plans
b-1: In relation to mid-term target：If the business operator takes actions under the sector-wide framework or plans to take measures including mitigation in abroad to offset the net increase emission over a natural gas power plant, it is judged as consistent with national targets and plans.
b-2: In relation to 2050 target：The government will accelerate development of the technologies which is targeted to be commercialized by around 2020, conduct survey on potential CO2 storage sites as a prerequisite for CCS, identify requirements for CCS Ready plants, and request business operators to study continuously including technological development in order to put carbon capture facilities towards commercialization.

The targets framed as ”Indicators of success” are “Work plans/action plans on climate change of every sector and level for short, medium and long term sector.” And “The rate of voluntary greenhouse gas emission reduction of every sector by 2050.” The process of finalising Thailand's preceding climate policy, “National Strategic Plan on Climate Change B.E. 2551-2555 (2008-2012)” was stalled because of protests about inadequate external participation

The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy specifies targets for reducing GHG emissions and provides a joint action plan to achieve emission reductions. The climate tax package changes to different taxes and subsidies (2MtCO2e by 2020) to balance future increases in energy and environmental taxes for enterprises and households against equivalent tax concessions, allows for a tax exemption for green cars (emissions of less than 120g of CO2/km) from vehicle tax. Furthermore the bill contains a carbon tax, which increases for heating in industry outside the scope of EU ETS such as agriculture, forestry and aquaculture (30% in 2011, 60% in 2015) and reduces the carbon tax rebate for diesel. It also facilitates green investments in developing countries, climate policy and development co-operation and an increased focus on climate change adaptation (responsibility to co-ordinate climate adaptation is given to country administrative boards; adapt spatial planning to increased risks of landslides; research on how climate change affects the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services and how negative effects can be limited).
The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy also contains action plans to promote renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and implement measures leading to a fossil-independent transportation sector.
Targets outlined in this legislation include:
– 40% GHGs from non-ETS sectors by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels)
– 50% of energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020
– 20% more efficient energy use (compared to 2008)
– 10% renewable energy in the transportation sector
– by 2020: a phase out of fossil fuels in heating
– by 2030: a vehicle fleet that is independent of fossil fuels

he Climate Settlement is officially known as “Recommendation of the Energy and Environment Committee: Climate Settlement, Innst. 390 S (2011-2012), based on the White Paper on Climate Efforts, Meld. St. 21 (2011-2012)”. This document reinforces the targets set out in the 2008 agreement on climate policy on transportation; construction; agriculture and carbon uptake by forests; and mainland industry and petroleum activities. Some of the core measures the document recommends to be adopted within these areas include:
• Create a climate and energy fund for development of technology and industrial transformation;
• Increase the offshore supply of electric power from the mainland, while safeguarding biological diversity;
• Increase state subsidies for investment in, and operation of, municipal public transportation and other environmentally-friendly forms of transportation;
• Adopt climate measures in agriculture and carbon removals in forests through active forest management;
• Maintain or increase the forest carbon stock through active, sustainable forest policies;
• Improve incentives for the use of bio-energy derived from wood (with emphasis on forest residues);
• Increase the mandatory sale of bio-fuels to 5%;
• Tighten the energy requirements in the building code to passive house level in 2015 and nearly zero energy level in 2020.
The settlement includes three main targets:
• In relation to the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, Norway plans to exceed its commitment by 10%
• Norway plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. However, if an ambitious global climate agreement is entered into through which other industrialised countries commit to undertake large reductions in GHG emissions, Norway will bring forward this target to 2030
• By 2020 Norway plans to commit to reducing its GHG emissions to an equivalent of 30% of the 1990 emissions level (and up to 40% contingent on global action)
While emissions reductions can be carried out in Norway or abroad, the paper states that Norway will have a domestic reduction goal of two-thirds of GHG emissions.","Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Energy efficiency, Renewables, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch",,In force,2012,,,Unknown,Mitigation,http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/law/climate-settlement-innst-390-s-2011-2012/,,,,,

The Law introduces several development schemes for the private development of renewable energy projects, including competitive bids, feed-in tariff, and independent power production through third party access.
Competitive bidding to be run by the New and Renewable Energy Authority (“NREA”) open to private sector companies for construction of the renewable power projects. Constructed stations will be operated by NREA. Produced electricity will be sold to Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) at a regulated price determined by Egyptian Electric Utility and Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency (ERA).
Competitive bidding mechanism for build-own-operate (BOO) contracts to be run by EETC and open to private companies for construction, ownership and operation of the renewable power projects. Generated electricity will be sold to EETC on the price agreed between EETC and plant owner.
Feed-in tariff (FIT) support system under which private sector investors are allowed to build, own and operate renewable energy power stations and sell generated electricity to EETC or to licensed distribution companies via power purchase agreements (PPA). PPA determines duration of the contract and a fix electricity price (feed-in tariff). PPA for feed-in tariffs for solar installations will last 20 years, for wind projects 25 years. Egypt aims to deploy 4300 MW of new renewable capacity under FIT scheme between 2015 and 2017. FIT system is open only for solar PV and wind technologies.
Independent power production through third party access scheme allows independent power producers (IPP) to enter bilateral electricity purchase contracts with eligible consumers and sell them produced electricity directly. EETC must allow for conclusion of such contract and make grid network available. In this case, EETC is allowed to charge and collect greed access fee for grid usage.",Renewables,,In force,2015,,,Unknown,Mitigation,https://thelawreviews.co.uk/edition/the-renewable-energy-law-review-edition-3/1229892/egypt,,,,,

In a first step to completely phase out fossil fuels the government targets the drop in the consumption of oil, gas and coal by 33% between 2009 and 2020.
The share of thermal production in total energy generation should also decrease from 71% to 40% over the same period.
To reach 100% of electricity from renewable, the Danish government greatly focuses on wind energy, expected to provide for 40% of total electricity needs, together with biomass and biogas. A solid district heating network, fed by renewable heat from biomass, will be the main motor of the energy transition in the heating sector.
Full independence from fossil fuels will also be reached through a solid and long term energy efficiency policy aiming at reducing gross energy consumption by 6% from 2006 levels. Energy companies will be required to increase energy savings by 50% in 2013 and 75% by 2017 to 2020. Electric meters diffusion will participate in moniotring energy demand in the residential sector.
In the building sector, the Danish government is going a step forward in implementing very ambitious building code, banning oil boilers in all new constructions and, by 2017, in all houses while biomass, biogas and solar thermal appliances will be strongly encouraged.
Denmark also targets the large scale deployment of offshore wind as well as dramatic growth in the wind manufacturing sector, and will fund research and development in for solar and wave power, support main demonstration projects for large heat pumps intended to be used in district heating plants and fund other geothermal energy research projects.
In order to generate revenues to finance the energy shift of the country, Denmark will introduce a public service obligation tax on electricity and gas, while tax on oil, gas and coal will be further increased to discourage their use.

The target status of Ukraine’s energy sector, at which the Strategy is aimed, is determined based on the need to:
• meet the population’s demand in both normal and emergency conditions;
• ensure the technically reliable and safe operation of the power supply system;
• provide for the economic efficiency of Ukrainian power supply systems and the energy sector in general;
• ensure the efficient energy use by the population and the national economy;
• find an environmentally sound solution to the environmental and climate impact of the energy sector;
• enable the state to form and implement policies aimed at protecting national interests regardless of the existing and potential internal and external threats to the energy sector.
The quantitative and qualitative targets of the Strategy are defined with due account of the need to ensure the sustainable development of the Ukrainian society in the long term, national economic priorities, and international obligations of Ukraine. The major targets for the period through 2035 are: 
• to reduce GDP energy intensity by 2035 to the level of 0.17 koe per 1 USD Ukrainian GDP (PPP) and to bring this indicator nearer to that of the countries with similar climatic, geographic, and economic conditions; 
• to optimize the structure of the country’s energy balance basing on energy security requirements and to bring the share of renewable energy to 20%; 
• to achieve by 2020 the level of dependence on energy supplies from a single country (company) not exceeding 30% of total imports (for nuclear fuel, targets are set separately);
• to achieve by 2035 the level of dependence on supplies from a single country not exceeding 30% of the total consumption of all types of energy; 
• to ensure a guaranteed compliance of generating capacities to the volumes and modes of energy consumption in the United Power System of Ukraine, particularly with regard to regulatory capacities availability; 
• to ensure by 2025 the technical integration of Ukrainian and European electricity and gas markets (cross-border transmission networks) amounting to at least 15% of Ukraine’s domestic market volume; 
• to form by 2035 a system of guaranteed power supplies to meet the demand of the national economy and the population during an emergency period equivalent to 90 days of consumption.

The 1994 decree determined the fixed tariff for solar electricity at ESP 10.42/kWh (€ 0.06/kWh). The Royal Decree (2818/1998) increased the tariff for solar electricity to € 0.22 to € 0.39/kWh. In 2000, it was revised and a new price at which a utility or supplier has to purchase renewable electricity from private generators was fixed. It ranges from € 0.03/kWh (for secondary biomass) to € 0.39/kWh (for PV under 5 kW). From 1999, wind electricity producers could receive either a fixed tariff of € 0.06/kWh or the average hourly market price of electricity plus a bonus of € 0.03/kWh. Rates are specified for both capacity and output credits. Output credits are the highest for wind and solar plants: € 0.07/kWh over a five-year period. Capacity credits are the highest for waste incineration plants; output credits for these plants vary depending on the size of the plant and on the relative importance of any co-fired fossil fuel. They also decrease annually. Buy-back rates for these plants are about € 0.06/kWh in the first year. Buy-back rates also depend on continuity of supply to avoid surges in power sold to the grid. The legislation also provides for guaranteed access to the electricity grid, with agreed rates for connection.

The new renewable energy law establishes more ambitious national renewable energy targets that should reach 20% of total national energy consumption and 40% of total electricity consumption by 2020. Moreover, 20% of energy used in heating and cooling and 10% of energy used in transportation have to come from renewable sources. The new legislation foresees the creation of a Special Renewable Energy Investment Service that will act as an interface between public institutions and investors, annually assess the main challenges to renewable energy deployment and manage the support funding allocation process. Existing remuneration of individual residents in areas where renewable energy projects are running have been amended and replaced by a credit on electricity bills. In fact, the law establishes that a share of the RE concession taxes paid by RE producers to regional and local authorities will will be allocated to local households as a credit on their electricity bill as a way to share the benefits of living nearby a renewable energy generation plant. The renewable energy generation licensing process has also been very much fasten and eased by the regulation that entitles the Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) with the assessment and issuance of licences, under the authority of the ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. The whole licensing process can not last over a 30-month period. Moreover, absolute priority is given to RES projects combined with desalination plants, when and only when the RES project is on an island and its capacity does not exceed 25% of the capacity of the desalination plant. The law also tackles the grid infrastructure challenge and implements a timely limited target for the grid utility to connect non-interconnected islands to the main grid. Still, RE projects are not granted grid priority access as grid connection will be established on a first-come first served basis until the network is saturated. The grid utility is compelled to provide grid access within four months after the connection demand has been released. The Law 3851 also establishes a whole new set of feed-in tariffs for electricity from renewable sources, to be found in the Greek FIT article.

This quota came into force at the start of 2010, and until 2014 will require 5% of electricity to come from non-conventional renewable energy sources. Starting from 2015, the obligation will be increased by 0.5% annually, reaching 10% in 2024.
The law will apply to all agreements executed as of 31 May 2007 (new agreements, renewals, extensions, or similar arrangements). Non-compliance with the law will result in fines of 0.4 UTM (Monthly Tax Unit), equivalent to approximately CLP 16,179 per MW not obtained from NCRE sources per year.
The obligation will last for 25 years (2010-2034). Hydro is considered as a non-conventional source if the capacity is below 20 MW. However, for a plant producing between 20 and 40 MW, a portion of the energy can be considered non-conventional based on a decreasing function, with the non-conventional energy content of a 40 MW plant equal to zero.

The plan is divided into five sections, the fifth of which is titled “Preserve life on the planet and save the human species” and speaks directly to environmental protections and climate change. The plan lists 12 broad and ambitious goals in relation to climate ranging from elaborating both mitigation and adaptation plans, to a number of objectives that pressure industrialised countries to follow through on international commitments and pay their “climate debt” in the form of reparations to less developed countries.
""The plan also lists a series of national policies and associated programmes (which appear to be primary possible strategic actions) related to the energy sector, environmental conservation and transport. For those policies related to climate change, it is unclear which programs are already n execution or ready for implementation.""

The plan seeks to improve energy efficiency and cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by developing renewable energy and expanding nuclear power capacity. The plan aims to cut energy consumption per unit of GDP by 3-5% per year. It also aims at increasing the share of renewable energy to 16% by 2030, and transport fuel from alternative sources such as gas or biofuels to 20% by 2020. The plan contains data on the greenhouse gas emissions in the Czech Republic, including projections of future development, and presents proposals for concrete measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and for adaptation measures. The programme was reviewed in 2007, and the review adopted by the government in April 2008. The review pointed to significant increase in the use of renewable energy sources, as well as progress in the agriculture and water management sectors. However, it found the Czech Republics energy intensity and GHG emissions per capita were comparatively high, and that transport sector emissions continued to increase. The National Climate Change Plan is thus being reviewed to emphasise measures targeting the industry and transport sectors, which contribute the most to GHG emissions, as well as to take into account the evolution of domestic, European and global political negotiations on climate change since 2004.

• Developing a national GHG emissions management system, whose objective is to establish an economy-wide emission reduction target by 2020. 
• Fostering national adaptation planning ;
• Providing a private sector-driven innovative diversification Program.

The National Energy Plan aims to install other sources of energy to achieve a diversification of the basket and ensure a reliable energy supply. The inclusion of wind power plants, photovoltaic solar generation, geothermal energy and generation from the biomass in the country's electric mix is ​​sought.
The UPME (Unit of Energy Mining Planning - Unidad de Planeación Minero Energética) identified the possible medium and long-term expansion alternatives that would allow the basket to diversify and have evaluated its impact on the system in the Expansion Reference-Generation and Transmission Plan 2014-2028. Several scenarios were presented. One of the scenarios considers the participation of more than 10% in non-conventional renewable energy in installed capacity by 2028, with a generation that ranges from 2.5% to 7.5% of total production in the period of analysis.
In the most feasible scenario, unconventional sources of energy may account for 6% of the electric energy basket, which would correspond to an installed capacity of 1,207 MW in 2028. In addition to the 474 MW of wind power in the pessimistic scenario, it is considered possible to install 143 MW of solar energy, 275 geothermal and 314 MW of biomass cogeneration.

However, itdoes include: ""• Mainstreaming climate change through wise management of resources and enhanced environmental conservation resulting in strengthened economic competitiveness and improved quality of life, • Integration of responses into national policies, plans and programmes to strengthen the resilience of development from arising and potential impacts of climate change, and • Strengthening of institutional and implementation capacity to better harness opportunities to reduce negative impacts of climate change."" (Objectives, NPCC 2010). The plan does highlight specific thrust areas to ""ST1-P1: Facilitate the harmonisation of existing policies to address climate change adaptation and mitigation in a balanced manner. ST2-P1: Institute measures to make development climate-resilient through low carbon economy to enhance global competitiveness and attain environmentally sustainable socio-economic growth. ST5-P2: Consolidate the energy policy incorporating management practices that enhances renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency (EE)."" (Page 6). The country also has a Cabinet Committee of Climate Change and a National Steering Committee of Climate change. The country has a policy on climate change but does not specifically meets our criteria of ""states in its title and/or in its statement of objectives limiting or reduce GHG emissions"". As a result Malaysia may not fall in category 1 or 2.

The implementation of the National Strategy should be ensured on four axes:
1. the establishment of a steering committee (national and provincial);
2. the regular convening of the Roundtable on Community Forestry (at both national and provincial levels) to intensify the dialogue between stakeholders involved; 
3. establishing a database of local community forest concessions; 
4. ongoing monitoring of these concessions to assess the impact on forest protection, as well as drivers of deforestation and degradation.

Main objective of the Algerian Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Development Plan is to expand usage of renewable energies and to diversify energy sources in the country.
Goals:
To install 22 000 MW of power generating capacity from renewable sources between 2011 and 2030 (of which 12 000 for internal usage and 10 000 MW for export);
To meet 20% of electricity generation from renewables by 2030
Renewable energy development will drive sustainable economic development of the country, increase energy security supply in Algeria and will have job-creation factor;
Solar energy (both solar PV and solar thermal) is recognized by the Algerian government as a primary renewable technology to be developed. The potential for wind, biomass, geothermal and hydropower energies is comparatively very small.
Combined, Algeria hopes to have more than 22 GW of renewable energy capacity installed by 2030, and has targeted the connection of 4.5 GW by 2020. Should Algeria hit its target, renewable energy would by 2030 account for 27% of the nations power outpout, offsetting the need for 22 GW of natural gas generation.

The present co-operation agreement was the basis for the elaboration of the first National Climate Plan (2009-2012), as well as establishment of the National Climate Commission. The Plan offers a detailed description of all existing formally approved climate change related measures for each sector (energy, industry, transport…) and cross-cutting issues (awareness-raising, exemplary role of the federal Government, etc.). The National Climate Plan also defines the 11 main axes of Belgium’s climate strategy:
• Energy production optimisation
• Efficient use of energy
• Industrial sector initiatives
• Development of sustainable transport
• Prioritisation of sustainable management of agricultural and forest ecosystems
• Continued efforts in waste management
• Increased climate change research
• Awareness-raising on climate change mitigation options
• Increased direct initiative of public authorities in reducing the GHG emissions
• Use of flexibility mechanisms (JI, CDM)
• Integrating the climate dimension into development aid policy
Climate change policy has been consolidated in the National Climate Plan (2009-2012). Since 2013, the National Climate Commission has been engaged in extending this Plan up to 2020, a process slowed down by the lack of agreement among the regions and the National government on burden-sharing of non-ETS targets for 2013 − 2020 as well as the share of renewable energies per region.","Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Energy efficiency, Renewables, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch",,In force,2002,,,Unknown,Mitigation,http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/law/the-co-operation-agreement-on-the-national-climate-plan-and-the-national-climate-plan/,,,,,

1. New huge hydro power plants (HPP) will be build:
a- Meghri HPP on the river Araks, expected production in 2017;
b- Shnogh HPP on the river Debed, contracts not signed yet therefore no estimation on potential time of production;
c- Loriberd HPP on the river Dzoraget, contracts not signed yet therefore no estimation on potential time of exploitation yet.
2. Existing HPPs (Vorotan HPP Complex and Dzora HPP) will undergo renovation
3. Steps to attract private investors will be taken.
Upon completion of the Strategic Development Program of Hydroenergy Sector of the Republic of Armenia it is expected that following targets will be achieved:
1- Additional 570 MW of electricity production will be added;
2- The share of renewable energy sources in annual domestic electricity production will increase;
3- The reliability of the electricity system will increase;
4- The energy dependence of Armenia from importing fossil fuels will considerably decrease;

The system is based on the recommendations of the commission of experts appointed to devise an emissions trading system, although final decisions have not been made on all the issues discussed by the commission. As a general rule, the emissions quotas should be sold, but in order to avoid carbon leakage, it may be necessary to provide quotas free of charge for some industries for a limited period of time.

They posited an unconditional contribution to reduce 22% of GHG emissions and a conditional contribution of up to 36% reduction below BAU, 774 MtCO2 and 638 MtCO2, respectively (Climate Action Tracker, 2020).

Mexico plans to cover all sectors. In a cross sectoral approach, the main measures outlined are Emission Trade System; Climate Finance Strategy, Circular Economy, Efficient Use of Energy. In the transport sector, Mexico aims the strengthening of regulations applicable to motor vehicles, the encouragement of alternative transportation systems, the promotion of clean transportation programs, the development and implementation of the National Electric Mobility Strategy and urban planning. In the electricity sector, it aims to increase participation of renewables, storage and smarter grids. Additionally, in the building sector the focus is on projects that optimize energy consumption in buildings and reduce the impacts of new constructions; to promote mechanisms and regulations that encourage the inclusion of best practices in constructions. Energy efficiency and circular economy are the kernel for the industrial sector.

According to Climate Action Tracker (2020), although both conditional and unconditional remained unchanged from Mexico’s 2016 NDC, its emission projections under BAU has been revised upwards.

For that, Cuba chose to use a variable reference year according to the action posited, ranging from 2014 (e.g. electricity generation based on Renewables) to 2020 (decrease of GHG in swine industry).

Some tasks are underscored, such as the urban planning, reforestation, increase the perception of population and mitigation/adaptation in core sectors.

The Specific Objective 11 and 15 are both related with mitigation practices, the former focusing on to increase energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy sources and the latter to Implement economic incentives (taxes, tariffs, credits and others) to achieve financial sustainability in the use and preservation of natural and environmental resources (Cuba NDC, 2020).

The plan encompasses all sectors (general) and touches upon all the mitigation areas analysed. A Climate Finance strategy, energy efficiency, urban planning and direct investments are measures that overarch all sectors aiming a reduction of carbon emissions. In the electricity sector, specifically, the focus is on augmenting the share of renewables and in the building in set standards, relying on solar panels both in residential and industrial areas. The novelty in this document when compared with the 2016 NDC is the inclusion of contributions on transportation, inciting a switch to less intensive or electric cars and forestry (Cuba NDC, 2020).

Cuba aims to increase 24% the energy generation with renewables by 2030 supported by direct investments from the government. Also, Cuba posits to increase energy efficiency, diminishing the use of fossil fuel in buildings and transportation by installation of solar heaters, LED lamps, induction cookers and fuel switch to a less intensive and e-mobile.

In the agriculture and forestry sector, the country posits reforestation as the main action. The commitment is to have 33% of the country covered with forest by 2030.

However, from these 7%, 5% corresponds to the private sector and 2% from the public sector.

The reference year chosen is 2010 and the BAU measured is 51 milGgCO2.

The country posited 46 Mitigation options in Transport, electricity, industry, agriculture and forestry sector, and also adaptation options. The policy instruments overarch all the sectors and mitigation areas. Special attention to fuel switch and investment in renewables in electricity, transport and industry sectors. Also, codes and standards for a less demand and more material efficiency are the base for the building sector, but also present in electricity and transport. Additionally, biomass is incited as a fuel rather than fossils in the industry and agriculture sector (Dominican Republic NDC, 2020).

The main policy instruments are possible to cite the economic strategic planning (Plan DECCC-2011 and Ley-1-12) and the Climate Change National policy (Decree 269-15 – PNCC 2015). Also, in the transport sector it is planned to set codes and standards to reduce GHG emissions (e.g. resource efficiency area – new lines, new modals, low carbon tech and electric cars). In the electricity sector the efforts are to increase the share of renewables (wind, solar and PCH) and fuel switch to a less intensive. In the building sector, Dominican Republic wants to improve energy efficiency (codes and standards visioning more efficiency) and resource efficiency to reduce the demand of energy, set new standards to introduce efficient lighting for public and residential areas. In addition, in the industry sector standards will be set for the acquisition of industrial electric motors and in biomass to replace fossil fuel.  Reforestation is also envisioned by the country.

Costa Rica tackles several sectors, establishing goals to achieve 8% of the country's fleet with zero emissions and also 8% of electric cars by 2030.

In the electricity and heat sector, it supports renewable energy (100% by 2030). Also, codes and standards are set aiming for energy efficiency of end users’ devices and a fuel switch is promoted by a moratorium on exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels.

The building sector is tackled with codes and standards driving for a more sustainable construction and material efficiency. Moreover, in the industry sector, renewable and low carbon energy are supported to move away from carbon-based production and towards a circular economy. Fiscal, tariffs and other price instruments are the base to support the forestry sector in order to achieve 60% of forest cover in the country without jeopardising the agricultural sector (Costa Rica NDC, 2020).

According to CAT, Costa Rica’s updated NDC has unconditional targets +2°C compatible. There is room for improvement by specifying the sectoral breakdown or the contribution of the forestry sector, and also by pushing for bolder goals in order to be 1.5°C compatible. CAT calculations show that when excluding LULUCF the total emissions in 2030 will be 12.3 to 12.9 MtCO2e in 2030, though there is some uncertainty due to the forestry contribution (Carbon Action Tracker, 2021).

The NDC sets an unconditional target of 95 MtCO2e by 2030. Also included 2025 as the peak year and a cap of emissions in the current decade of 1100MtCO2e.

For the LULUCF sector, Chile focuses on forest restoration, afforestation and reducing deforestation as carbon sink. The final goal is to reach neutrality by 2050.

Chile planns to strengthen its policy legal framework, exchange technology with international actors and build capacity through education at national level. Also, public-private alliances are supported by the government to finance action. In the building sector, Chile relies on targets, codes and standards and in the transport envisages to incite e-mobility and hydrogen to replace diesel. Fuel switching is also the way forward in the industry sector, from coal to electricity and biogas besides an increment in the efficiency. In the electricity sector, Chile wants to reduce GHG emission by phasing-out mineral coal, shifting to thermal and solar electrification (Chile NDC, 2020).

According to CAT this updated NDC still is insufficient to comply with Paris Agreement goals. However, this NDC is stronger than the previous, establishing 95 MtCO2e in 2030 as a wider goal, having the peak of emissions in 2025 followed by a downward trend until net-zero in 2050 and a smaller emission budget until 2030. Also, Chile establishes a target in the forestry sector.

While analysing the conditional target of up to 45% GHG emission reductions by 2030 from 2016 levels, CAT concludes that is a bolder target. However, there are no details in the NDC for a complete assessment (Carbon Action Tracker, 2021).

In CAT analysis, this new NDC will result in emissions between 24.6 and 27.2 MtCO2e in 2030, falling in a range warming that may reach between 2 and 3 degrees (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).","Energy efficiency, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Non-energy use, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Renewables",,In force,2020,2021,2030,Unknown,Mitigation,"https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Norway%20First/Norway_updatedNDC_2020%20(Updated%20submission).pdf

For CO2, CH4 and N2O the reference year is 1990 and for F-gases the reference year is 1995. The UK’s overall absolute target is to reduce GHG emissions at least by 68% (including LULUCF) by 2030 compared with reference levels. Emissions from International Aviation and Shipping are not included.

The UK has a policy framework in force establishing the binding commitment of net zero emissions by 2050, and Scotland sets bolder goals to reach net-zero in 2045 and 75% below 1990 by 2030. Wales pledges at least 80% reduction by 2050. 

The Climate Change Act introduced carbon budgets for the UK Government, which cap emissions over successive five-year periods and must be set 12 years in advance.

The UK government is putting into force the Clean Growth Strategy, which is a Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution, encompassing clean energy, buildings, transport and technologies. Moreover, the government pushes for individual plans across key sectors such as Energy White Paper, Transport Decarbonisation Plan and Heat and Buildings Strategy (UK NDC, 2020).

UK’s NDC establishes a reduction of 68% of 1990 levels including LULUCF emissions. If LULUCF is excluded, this is equivalent to 69% or 251 MtCO2e. CAT classifies this as strong target and once the UK adopts national policies (2030 ban on the sale of fossil fuel cars and a ramping up of renewable energy investment, particularly into offshore wind) it will bring their emissions in line with the 1.5°C goal. Also, the UK has a net-zero goal by 2050. CAT cannot rate, at this moment, the UK target due to complexities derived from Brexit (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

It is an economy-wide and absolute pledge, covering all sectors and gases (EU NDC, 2020).

The overarching measures in force in EU are three-folded: Emissions reduction targets under current EU legislation are divided between the sectors covered by the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS), which is put a price in the carbon and established a cap for emission allowances; by the non-ETS sectors under the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), which individual binding targets for Member States is set considering emissions not covered by the EU ETS; and land-use related emissions and removals addressed by the regulation on emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF).

Additionally, the EU passed regulations to improve energy efficiency (improve at least 32.5% by 2030), for increasing renewable energy in final energy consumption (at least 32% by 2030) and reduce CO2 emissions in the road transport sector, increasing performance (reducing emissions) of cars and lorries.

The EU agreed to reduce at least 55% GHG emissions below 1990 levels by 2030. Though this is a stronger target, it is not enough to reach 1.5°C, and a proposal between 58% and 70% is needed (European Parliament proposed 60%). Also due to methodological complexities caused by Brexit, CAT cannot rate this NDC. Nevertheless, CAT points out that the reduction would have to be between 2,324 – 2,329 MtCO2e or 52.8% (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

CAT suggests more ambitious policy measures, which would lead to significant reductions. For instance, revise the Renewable Energy Directive based on new proposals from the ‘Fit for 55%’ package, and decrease the emissions cap of the EU-ETS, steering a coal phase-out and better performance for cars and the increase in the share of electrical vehicles.

For CO2, CH4 and N2O the reference year is 1990 and for F-gases the reference year is 1995. In the reference year its emissions were 102.74 KtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) which has been decreasing during the 2000s, reaching 86,93 KtCO2e in 2018. There is no agriculture sector in the country. Monaco has set the goal to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050. For this, Monaco is setting efforts embedded in a national policy framework.

In the electricity sector, the goal is to reduce consumption of fossil fuels, so Monaco is trying to improve energy efficiency and decarbonise energy, investing in solar thermal and PV and geothermal networks. In buildings, also, the replacement of fossil fuels to biofuels is being incentivised, as well as, increasing environmental performance and energy efficiency of the buildings using sustainable codes and methods of construction and financial mechanisms for renovations. In the transport sector, Monaco focuses on the reduction of traffic and decarbonisation of the transport. A shift to other modals and public transportation is supported though electric public transportation. Lastly, the industry sector is weak in Monaco being mainly related to craft and cross sectoral measures about electricity will also cover this sector.

Market mechanisms under the article 6 is a possible outlined in the NDC to be used in the future to achieve the outlined reductions of GHG emissions (Monaco NDC, 2020).

The goal is to reach 193,73 GgCO2e. The implementation period is set to be between 2021 and 2030 and covers all GHG and F-gases.

In the electricity sector, Andorra aims to increase national production of energy to 33% (50% by 2050), being more than 75% (85% by 2050) from renewable sources. In the transport sector the country aims to reduce 50% GHG emissions, setting a binding legislation to promote electric motorized mobility or from a source low in GHG emissions. Lastly, in the building sector, the country suggests regulations enforcing that new buildings have neutral energy consumption.  

Andorra has created a national voluntary market to help the reduction of GHG.
